	abstract = {Abstract We review the literature documenting more than 25 years of progress in the design of computer software for repertory grids. First, analysis programs are reviewed; then programs that arc designed specifically for grid elicitation are discussed; finally, multifunction software packages (i.e., those that perform grid construction, elicitation, and/or analysis) are reviewed. Comparisons are offered, not only between the particular programs, but also between the single-function and multifunction categories. Directions for future development are considered.},
